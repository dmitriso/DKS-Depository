        <p>Migrating from Maryland to Philadelphia about three years ago. Before enrolling in UPenn's LPS Coding Bootcamp, I was a licensed Cosmetologist (Hairstylist) for about seven years. Due to the global pandemic, I was presented an opportunity to make a career change. Always having a passion for coding, tech, and gaming. I have accumulated a trove of useful knowledge and technical skills. Teaching my self-everything from basic Web-Development to Leatherworking. I have also owned and ran my own business for several years as well. Incorporating my creative affinity to design and handcrafting, I have always sought to conceive and construct from the ground up. Being a natural problem solver, passionate learner, and a resourceful individual is second nature to me. With hard work, dedication, and passion I expect these qualities to show case my commitment to the industry. I hope my diverse experiences have provided me with a unique thought process to take me far as a Web Developer. I love coding, designing, and all forms of creation. Surrounded by many experienced peers and mentors, I am extremely excited to become a UPenn LPS Full Stack Web Developer so I can work on the forefronts of this Digital Age! Please enjoy portfolio and feel free to contact me for any opportunities and/or messages.</p>
