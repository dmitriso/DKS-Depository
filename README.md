## Description

<p> With an oppurtunity to evolve my original portfolio design, I took advatage of the skills and tools I've gained since its first rendition. Using React to create this portfolio was a main focus for me. My vision for what is presented far exceeds my current deadline, therefore I've curated an updated style with some animations to bring it closer to my ultimate goal! Please enjoy the newest version of my website. </p>
